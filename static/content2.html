      </h2>

    <p>
      Let’s try to understand with the help of a story, in June 1914

      <!-- <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'img src/blog/ferd.jpg') }}
        " alt="Ferdinand" style="width:200px;" class = "wrap"> -->

      <img src="./img src/blog/ferd.jpg" alt="Ferdinand" class="wrap">
      The crowned prince of
      Hungary, Franz
      Ferdinand, with his wife was going to
      take a tour on the streets of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" target="_blank" class="hyper">Bosnia <span  class ="ptext">Bosnia, is a country in South and Southeast Europe, located within the Balkans.</span></a>
      and by mistake, he
      took a wrong turn and this was the worst mistake made by him.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      That “turn” changed the whole world. He was going in
      the direction which was totally unplanned. On the same path a revolutionary,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavrilo_Princip" class="hyper" target="_blank"> Gavrilo Princip <span class ="ptext">

        <!-- <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'img src/blog/gavriloprincip.jpg') }}
        " alt="Gp" style="width:200px;"> -->

        <img src="./img src/blog/gavriloprincip.jpg"  width="200px"><br><br>Gavrilo Princip was a Bosnian Serb member of Young Bosnia who sought an end to Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</span></a>was eating a sandwich. Now is where things gets intrested.
      Gavrilo shot him and his wife. Gavrilo was not there with an intention to kill him. He was just eating a sandwich and enjoying his day, but
      when he saw Ferdinand, he didn't wanted to miss that opportunity.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      In <span class="hyper">Upheaval <span  class ="ptext">
        a violent or sudden change or disruption to something.</span></span>, Austria
        and Hungary attacked Serbia. The immediate reason for Austria's ultimatum was the assassination of Franz
        Ferdinand and his wife Sophie in Sarajevo, Bosnia on June 28, 1914, by the Bosnian-Serb nationalist, Gavrilo
        Princip. With Franz Ferdinand's death, Austria had the pretext it wanted to put the smaller and weaker Serbians
        in their place. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Russia mobilized its armed forces to defend Serbia because Russia wanted to gain influence in
        the Balkans and deter Austria-Hungary and Germany. And because of diplomatic and friendship agreements between
        different countries, other countries also have to include with their armies and a total of 32 countries involved
        in order to help each other and this led to the cruel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" class="hyper" target="_blank">“The World War I”<span class ="ptext">
          World War I, also known as the First World War or the Great War, was a global war that lasted from 1914 to 1918. Contemporaneously described as "the war to end all wars",it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, making it one of the largest wars in history.</span></a>

        <img src="./img src/blog/ww1.jpg" alt="" class= "wrap" style="float:left; width: 300px;">

        <!-- <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'img src/blog/ww1.jpg') }}
        " alt="WW1" style="width:300px; float:left;" class = "wrap"> -->
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        

        A small turn, indeed changed into that big event.What would have happened if Ferdinand had not choosen that way?.There were around 40 million casualties. About 20
        million deaths and 21 million wounded.
        Now, if world war 1 would have never happened then
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" class="hyper" target="_blank">the treaty of Versailles<span class ="ptext">
          The Treaty of Versailles was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end. The Treaty ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919 in Versailles, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which had directly led to the war.</span></a>
          
        would be never signed and The Adolf Hitler would never
        be able to inflame Germans to led “World War 2”, due to which around 1.5 million Jews would not have died and 85
        million people(3% of the world population of that time, 1940 ) would not have perished. England and Russia also
        suffered a lot in “World War 2”.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        This also brought changes in the scientific field. Albert
        Einstien
        in order to prove relativity theory, went to Russia to find the pictures of the
        total solar eclipse but due to ongoing war, the electronic devices of Einstein and his friend
        <!-- <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'img src/blog/albert-einstein.jpg') }}
        " alt="albert" style="width:300px;" class = "wrap"> -->
        <img src="./img src/blog/albert-einstein.jpg" alt="albert-einstein" style="width: 300px;" class="wrap">
        were seized. So they have to wait for 6 years until the war ends. While cursing his luck, he was going through
        his work and <strong>found a "big mistake"</strong> in his calculation, then he refined his theory and prepared a fresh model which
        was later approved.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        If the world war didn’t take place then maybe his theory got rejected and this revolutionary
        theory and the inventions based on this theory will not be with us. 
        Although Jewish people consist of only 0.2%
        of the total world population yet 20% of all the Nobel prize winners are Jewish people.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        we
        must not forget that Albert Einstein was also a Jew. Just think how many capable and smart people got killed due
        to Hitler and with the help of those people may be the world was more developed than now.
        Isn’t it interesting that a wrong turn took by Ferdinand would have caused that much change?
        <!-- <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'img src/blog/star_of_david.jpg') }}
        " alt="albert" style="width:300px;" class = "wrap"> -->

        This is “The Chaos Theory”. A small change that led to a bigger change. The influence of small things supporting
        that change until they became so big that it is out of control. 
        
        <br>
        We have often observed that coin tosses are used to make several decisions in different sports. The team which
        wins the toss has the right to make that decision. So the question is “Why do we use coin toss for this
        purpose?”. You may answer,because it's random. Well, you are somewhat right but what if I say that it’s not
        <a href="./content1.html">“RANDOM”</a>.
        <br>
        <br>

        <img src="./img src/blog/chaos.jpg" alt="albert-einstein" style="width: 300px; " class="wrap" >

        In the 1960s,
        
        
        
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavrilo_Princip" class="hyper" target="_blank"> Edward Lorenz <span class ="ptext">

        <img src="./img src/blog/Edward_lorenz.jpg" width="200px"></span></a> , a meteorologist at MIT, was trying to perform an early weather
        simulation. He was trying to predict the weather through some mathematical calculations. When he put those
        values into the weather simulator, the simulator was showing sunny weather. Then he did those mathematical
        calculations with the help of a computer.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The results were the same. Then he put those values in the weather
        simulator, then the simulator was showing completely different results. The simulator showed it is going to
        storm and thunder. He was confused by the fact that though the results were the same then, why it is not showing
        the same results again. Then going through the whole calculations done by him and the computer, he observed a
        <!-- <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'img src/blog/decimal.png') }}
        " alt="albert" style="width:300px;" class = "wrap"> -->
        <img src="./img src/blog/decimal.png" alt="decimal" style="width: 300px;float:left; " class="wrap" >
        difference that he rounded off the value of the number that was up to 6 decimal places to 3 decimal
        places
        which made the whole difference between the predictions. Now you may understand why it is so
        difficult to predict the weather precisely.
        This is why it is difficult to predict the future. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        (Vsauce video)
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        We can predict the future if we know about the various things
        that are going to process.
         We will able to tell while throwing a dice what would be the result if we know
        certain things that will affect it like gravity, air resistance, angle of throw, the force of the throw, and
        <!-- <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'img src/blog/fantasy-2790666_640.jpg') }}
        " alt="albert" style="width:300px;" class = "wrap"> -->
        <img src="./img src/blog/fantasy-2790666_640.jpg" alt="decimal" style="width: 300px; " class="wrap" >
        many other things. And in the near future, we will be able to make correct weather predictions and we can also
        predict changes in the growth of the stock market, outcomes of political matters, etc. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        That future is
        near!

        (And {can we add a blog link?}The Butterfly Effect, an underlying principle of chaos, describes how a small change in one state of a
        deterministic non-linear system can result in large differences in a later state. -Wikipedia)
