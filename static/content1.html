      <h2>Creepy coincidences?
      </h2>
    </div><sub>  By-TheModOps</sub>

    <p>
      When you reverse Neil Armstrong saying 'small step for man'
      you can hear what sounds like - man will space walk
      <br>
      <br>

      You can practice speaking backwards, so when your words are reversed
      their intelligible.
      <br>
      <br>
      <!-- Insert voice reverse here -->

      But ,Why can a mere coincidence give us chills
      and why is it so fun?



      But here's something else that is weird.

      The digits in the speed of light are exactly the same
      as the latitude of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

      #Insert image of giza and latitude.


      What does all of this mean?
      Are these just coincidences?
      Or are greater powers at work?

      If a word can be spelt the same forward
      and backward, it's a palindrome.
      But if a word or phrase
      sounds the same, whether spoken forward or rewound,
      it is a phonetic palindrome.
      For example,

      say yes. Reversed (#add yes reverse here)
      Pretty cool.


      By the way, some people can speak in reverse on the fly
      It is really cool to see them in action.
      Watch Guy's lean back
      after this video. It's linked down in the description and it's full of pretty cool coincidence videos.


      Apophenia is the perception of connections or patterns
      in information.

      One type of Apophenia is Pareidolia -
      the scene or hearing of things that weren't meant to be there.

      For instance, hearing your name being called or your phone ringing
      in the sound of running water, or hearing English words
      in a non-English song
      (#insert Indian misheard lyrics videos)

      or seeing faces
      that weren't purposely placed there.
      (#Images of faces on planets)


      Our brains are good at this kind of work,
      probably because being hyper attentive to patterns and faces
      can save your life.

      If there's ambiguity as to whether that
      thing hiding in the shadows is a threat, or just a shadow,
      it's advantageous to air on the side
      of threat. Organisms with a healthy sense of Apophenia
      live longer, long enough to have kids and raise them
      and naturally become the norm. We connect with
      faces so well

      (Hutson relates a story of a friend who draws
      faces on things she doesn't wanna lose, like her bags.
      She says the faces make her less likely to forget about them.)
      If you like it, you should have put a ring on it, if you like not losing it,
      you should have drawn a face on it.


      We are so good at
      teasing out patterns and faces from random noise
      actual random sequences don't always
      feel random to us.
      (#insert funny "random" youtube links that is random but have meaning )


      Originally, Apple's iTunes shuffle feature generated complaints from users.
      They said that similar songs, or songs from the same artist,
      appeared in a string, which, of course, is to be expected
      from randomness but it didn't feel random enough.


      So Apple introduced a smart shuffle
      that avoided totally random sequences that nonetheless
      didn't seem random to our pattern loving brains.

      As Steve Jobs explained, "we're making it less random
      to make it feel more random".


      Our impressive ability to imagine patterns also expresses itself when it
      comes to connecting songs
      and moving images. This dancing Spider-Man animation will
      (#insert spiderman animation here)
      famously sync up with any music you play.
      Try it.
      (#play background music )


      What kind of black magic is going on here?
      Well, as it turns out, most of it is in our heads.
      Radiolab reported that Michigan State University explains that the major movements
      of dancing animations like this one, or this one,
      move at typical song tempos but also contain, like most
      dance, various other different related rhythms of movement allowing them to seemingly
      fit many different tempos.




      Selection bias helps a lot too.
      We fall prey to this when we reject all the times the animation
      doesn't really sync up, focusing instead on the more surprising times
      when it does.

      The bizarre pyramid coincidence mentioned earlier
      is a lot less bizarre when you consider the fact that we got to control where
      we placed the decimal point,
      and that a number of degrees this precise isn't necessary to locate the pyramid.
      (#insert degree presions versus length, wikipedia)


      By the fourth decimal we're only talking about a matter of a few meters,
      so it's easy to make the rest fit the speed of light exactly
      and have still picked a point on the pyramid.
      Confirmation bias also comes into play here.
      If you really want two things to sync up,
      they will.

      We often look for evidence that supports what we already believe,
      while marginalising things against it.

      As Marshall McLuhan said "I wouldn't have seen it, if I hadn't believed it".

      These biases also help explain the seemingly mind-blowing coincidence that
      famous movies and famous albums can line up.
      (#pink floyd )

      One the most popular states that if you start playing Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon
      at the same time as The Wizard of Oz, they will eerily
      line up. Entire communities have sprouted around the syncing
      of movies and albums. Some of my favorites are the Yellow Submarine soundtrack
      and the Little Mermaid, Lorde's Pure Heroine and Twilight Saga - Breaking Dawn 2,
      and the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey
      with Pink Floyd's Echoes.
      There are conspiracies
      that these were somehow secretly planned, though in reality
      they're just accidental music videos. The product of selection bias,
      confirmation bias and
      the law of near enough.
      A behaviour of our pattern sensitive minds.
      Two things don't have to line up exactly, or literally,
      for us to see a connection. This is why vague predictions
      are a great way to look psychic. These are also actually
      unsurprising when you consider the fact that the number of narrative
      paces and rhythms we enjoy, and typically use,
      are much smaller than the number possible.
      In 'The Improbability Principal', David J Hand calls this
      "the probability lever".
      What may be rare
      on average, or when considering all possible scenarios,
      can be less rare for specific scenarios,
      even if they are only marginally different. Getting struck by lightning
      is a proverbially unlikely event, but Walter Summerford
      wasn't just struck by lightning once during his life,
      he was struck three times. It never
      killed him but four years after his death
      his gravestone was also struck by lightning.
      What are the chances? I mean, clearly Summerford was some sort of
      robot built out of lightning rods or had somehow angered Zeus,
      right?
      Probably not. You see, while for the average person
      the chance have been struck by lightning is quite low, for an avid outdoor
      sportsman like Summerford,
      it's not as low.
      The law of truly large numbers
      also comes into play here.
      With lightning striking Earth forty to fifty times a second, billions of people
      for it to strike and
      thousand of years of recorded history, it's actually not surprising at all
      that at least once a story like Summerford's
      would have happened.
      Given the truly large number of people
      who visit Disney World every day, and the fact that they take photos and lots of them,
      it's actually not surprising at all that at least one so far,
      a story like Alex and Donna Voutsinas' has happened.
      While sorting through old photos before their wedding, Alex and Donna found a photo
      of Donna
      at Disney World, fourteen years before the couple met.
      But then Alex noticed something. He too had visited Disney World as a child, and there,
      in the background, was his father pushing him in a stroller.
      Sometimes coincidences can be tragic.
      In 1864, Abraham Lincoln's son,
      Robert Lincoln, was saved from serious injury - or possibly even
      death - when a stranger grabbed him by the shirt collar
      moments before he plunged on the train tracks below.
      That stranger turned out to be Edwin Booth, one of the most famous
      Shakespearean actors of the time. So famous in fact Robert recognized him
      and had a letter sent thanking him for saving his life. Less than a year later
      Edwin Booth's brother, John Wilkes Booth, undid the favor by
      assassinating Abraham Lincoln.
      Strange as they seem at first,
      math says that given enough time and psychology says that given enough interest
      in finding them,
      coincidences and connections will be found,
      even unlikely ones. The coincidences between
      Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy are famous.
      Both were elected to the presidency in the year ending with sixty.
      Lincoln was shot at Ford's Theatre,
      Kennedy was shot in a 1961 Lincoln Continental four-door convertible,
      made by Ford.
      Both presidents' last names have seven letters
      and both assassins had 15 letters in their names.
      The list goes on, as it should.
      If you look long enough, you can find coincidences between any two people or
      things or events.
      They may seem strange at first but tend to wind up being in the end
      pretty expected. For just one example,
      name length isn't that wildly variable.
      Seven-letter names are pretty common. Lincoln,
      Kennedy. Michael. Stevens
      In the famous spooky presidential coincidences contest,
      held by the Skeptical Inquirer in 1992, one contestant alone
      found similar lists of crazy coincidences
      between 21 pairs of former presidents.
      Given the vast amount of details in any one of our lives,
      it's pretty easy. This court can be exploited to almost comedic heights
      when it comes to over-analysing.
      Of course, hidden messages and signs are often intentionally included in media
      for fun, or to reward attentive viewers.
      But unintentional, extraordinary things
      happen all the time. It's not really that extraordinary.
      There's a famous calculation
      that is known as Littlewood's law. Given the number of hours
      we are awake every day, and assuming an event only takes about a second to occur,
      if you calculate the odds of something happening to you are only one in a million.
      Well, you should expect that thing to happen to you about once every 35 days.
      David J Hand took this even further with seven billion people on Earth
      the chance that an event with a one in a million probability of happening
      to each of us won't happen today is 1
      in 10 to 3040. As Persi Diaconis put it,
      the truly unusual day would be a day where
      nothing unusual happens.
      And as always,
      thanks for watching.
      You may have noticed a lot of YouTube channels making videos about learning this week.
      Well, that is not a coincidence. It is school of YouTube week.
      Many people are going back to school or college right now
      but across the world millions of children won't be
      either because they work to support their families
      or live without a home. Or in areas where there is conflict.
      They may experience overcrowding at school or a lack of teaching
      and school supplies. But luckily, we can help.
      Donations to Comic Relief's School of YouTube campaign
      can help disadvantaged young people all around the world
      get an education. It doesn't take much to change a life.
      You can learn more in the description below or donate right now.
